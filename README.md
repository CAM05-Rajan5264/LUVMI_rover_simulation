# LUVMI_rover_simulation

Small application for the [LUVMI project](https://www.luvmi.space/) . You can control with keyboard, or gamepad (all is set for a Xbox controller, other controllers may have different mapping).


## WebGL

Tested with Firefox 56.0 32-bit.
For the sake of performances, the quality of the web version is less than the desktop application.
